## ⏫ Updating

Since AppImages are self-contained executables, there is no formal installation process beyond setting executable permissions.

<details>
  <summary><b>Update (Manual)</b></summary>

1. Download the latest AppImage package from the [releases](https://github.com/psadi/ghostty-appimage/releases) section.
1. Follow the same steps as in the [Installation](#installation) section to make it executable and run it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Update (Automatic)</b></summary>

1. Use [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) which reads the update information in the AppImage. This is a low level tool.
1. Use a higher level tool that uses AppImageUpdate, like [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher), [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) or [appimaged](https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage/blob/master/src/appimaged/README.md) daemon, these tools also automatically handle desktop integration.
